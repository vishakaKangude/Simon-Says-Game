# MindMimic
MindMimic is a fun and interactive browser-based game that challenges the player’s memory. The game displays a sequence of colors that the player must repeat. The sequence becomes progressively longer with each correct attempt.

Features-
Randomly generated color sequences.
Progressively increasing difficulty.
Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile browsers.
Visual and audio feedback for correct and incorrect inputs.

How to Play
Start the Game: Press the "Start" button.
Watch the Sequence: The game will highlight a series of colors in a specific order.
Repeat the Sequence: Click the colors in the same order as displayed.
Level Up: Each correct sequence adds one more color to the sequence.
Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

Feedback: Provides audio and visual cues for correct and incorrect inputs.
Game Progression: Adds a new color to the sequence after each successful level
